# Phase 2.1: Brand Story & Process

## Objective
Deepen the "noir" boutique experience by explaining *who* the agency is and *how* they work.

## Features
### 1. About / Philosophy Section
- **Visuals**: Split layout (50/50). Left side high-quality monochrome photography; right side elegant typography.
- **Typography**: Extensive use of **Playfair Display** for philosophical statements.
- **Motion**: Parallax effect on the image; staggered text reveal on scroll.

### 2. The Boutique Process (Timeline)
- **Concept**: A vertical "line of excellence" that tracks scroll progress.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Discovery**: Defining the void and the vision.
    2. **Curation**: Selecting materials and digital textures.
    3. **Execution**: Precision engineering and design.
    4. **Unveiling**: The final artifact delivery.
- **Motion**: As the user scrolls, the line grows, and each step's content fades in from the side.
